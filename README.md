# PDF AUDIO READER

A **simple** and **offline** PDF audio reader using Python.


## How it works?

The task can be simply divided into 2 steps:

1. Extract text from PDF. Refer [read.py](https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/PDF_AUDIO_READER/blob/master/read.py) for a sample.

2. Convert text to speech. Refer [speak.py](https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/PDF_AUDIO_READER/blob/master/speak.py) for a sample.

[pdf_audio_reader.py](https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/PDF_AUDIO_READER/blob/master/pdf_audio_reader.py) contains the complete code.
